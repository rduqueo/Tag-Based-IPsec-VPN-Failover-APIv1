# Tag-Based-IPsec-VPN-Failover-APIv1

This script is based of ryanpjbyrne, guillaume6hat, and Meraki provided script: https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/Site-to-site_VPN/Tag-Based_IPsec_VPN_Failover. Thank you Guys!!

I just modified the API Calls, data manipulation, and some prints, in order to use Meraki APIv1 Endpoints and Python3.
